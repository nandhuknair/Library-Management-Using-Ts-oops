## ðŸ“š TypeScript Project

## Overview

Welcome to the TypeScript Project! This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including inheritance and polymorphism, using TypeScript. It features classes for managing books and users (e.g., librarians) to showcase the power and flexibility of TypeScript for creating structured and maintainable code.

## Features

- **Inheritance**: Extend functionality from a base class.
- **Polymorphism**: Override methods to provide specific implementations.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilize classes and objects to manage data effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
